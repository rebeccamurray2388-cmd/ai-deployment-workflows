# AI Deployment & Adoption Workflows

This repository documents practical, real-world workflows that help teams move from
first exposure to sustained, high-leverage daily usage of AI tools.

## Problem
Teams adopt powerful tools, but usage stalls when workflows, ownership,
and enablement don’t scale.

## Approach
Embed AI directly into real work with:
- clear rollout sequencing
- lightweight guardrails
- early usage signals
- enablement that scales without headcount

## Artifacts
- Deployment and adoption playbooks
- AI-assisted enablement workflows
- Notes on prompt and context strategy

## Case Studies

Detailed examples of cross-functional operating models in practice:

- [Enterprise Customer Activation Operating Model](case-studies/enterprise-customer-activation.md)  
  Centralized ownership of onboarding across 600+ activations, driving predictable time-to-value and ~80% stronger renewal/expansion likelihood.

## Tools
- Cursor
- ChatGPT
- GitHub

## Status
Production-ready operating models designed for scale.
