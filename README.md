AI Deployment & Adoption Workflows

Production-grade operating systems that integrate AI directly into enterprise tooling and workflows.

This repository focuses on operational integration — embedding AI into systems of record, automation layers, and governance structures to drive measurable outcomes at scale.

Problem

Teams adopt AI tools, but usage fragments when workflows remain manual, ownership is unclear, and system integration is shallow.

Without structured deployment, AI becomes assistive rather than embedded — increasing cognitive load instead of reducing it.

Approach

Embed AI into live systems by:

Integrating logic into systems of record (e.g., Salesforce)

Syncing structured attributes via reverse ETL (e.g., Hightouch)

Converting qualitative inputs into structured signals

Automating routing and enrollment workflows

Installing measurable governance and early performance indicators

Objective: workflow-level integration — not surface-level tool adoption.

Artifacts

Production implementations include:

AI-assisted intake classification workflows

Structured routing logic embedded into CRM + LMS systems

Modular, version-controlled operating frameworks

Governance dashboards and signal tracking

Deployment sequencing playbooks

All artifacts are designed to reduce manual coordination, improve signal integrity, and enable scalable iteration.

Case Studies

Deployment-level examples of AI embedded into live operating environments:

🔹 Enterprise Customer Activation Operating Model

Centralized onboarding governance across 600+ activations, improving time-to-value and renewal predictability.

🔹 AI-Embedded Operating Model Deployment (Partner Ecosystem)

Increased accreditation adoption by 35% (200+ Advocates certified), raised partner-engaged ARR from 10% to 14%, and enabled AI-assisted routing for 50+ concurrent participants without incremental headcount.

Systems & Tooling

Salesforce (system of record)

Hightouch (reverse ETL / attribute normalization)

LMS integration for automated enrollment

Generative models for signal extraction and content restructuring

GitHub for documentation + version control

Status

Production-tested, cross-functional operating models built for enterprise deployment and iterative scale.
