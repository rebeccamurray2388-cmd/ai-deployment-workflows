# Enterprise Customer Activation Operating Model

## Executive Summary

Centralized ownership of enterprise onboarding across 600+ activations, redesigning fragmented workflows into a structured activation system that improved time-to-value, renewal predictability, and cross-functional accountability.

## What Was Deployed

Designed and implemented a milestone-based activation governance model that unified Sales, Services, and Customer Success under a structured onboarding framework. Installed defined sequencing, ownership clarity, and early usage signal tracking to reduce escalations and increase predictability across enterprise accounts.

## Systems & Tooling

Integrated governance directly into Salesforce as the system of record, aligned activation milestones with revenue tracking, and embedded performance visibility across GTM teams. Documentation and workflow standards were version-controlled to ensure repeatability and transparency.

## Structural Transformation

Moved onboarding from reactive, team-dependent coordination to a centralized, milestone-driven operating model with measurable oversight and defined accountability loops.

## Outcomes

Managed 600+ enterprise activations under unified governance, compressed time-to-value, improved renewal and expansion likelihood, and reduced cross-functional friction across high-value accounts.
# AI-Embedded Operating Model Deployment (Partner Ecosystem)

## Executive Summary

Deployed generative AI into core partner operating workflows to modernize accreditation, strategic planning infrastructure, and large-cohort training systems, driving measurable adoption, revenue impact, and scalable execution without incremental headcount.

## What Was Deployed

Embedded AI-driven feedback synthesis into accreditation redesign to surface recurring friction and misalignment. Applied generative AI to modularize legacy partner playbooks, transforming static documentation into reusable activation frameworks. Built AI-assisted intake classification integrated with LMS routing to automate enrollment and reduce manual coordination.

## Systems & Tooling

Integrated AI-assisted logic into Salesforce workflows and leveraged structured attribute synchronization via Hightouch to improve signal integrity. Connected intake routing directly to LMS systems for automated enrollment. Maintained deployment artifacts in version-controlled environments to support iteration and governance.

## Structural Transformation

Replaced static, manually coordinated enablement assets with modular, AI-assisted systems that reduced cognitive load, improved routing accuracy, and enabled scalable partner activation aligned to revenue workflows.

## Outcomes

Drove a 35% increase in accreditation adoption (200+ Advocates certified), increased partner-engaged ARR from 10% to 14% in post-sales pilot accounts, secured executive sponsorship converting the pilot into a formalized program, and enabled AI-assisted routing for 50+ concurrent participants without additional operational headcount.
# Enterprise AI Deployment Governance & Transformation Framework

## Executive Summary

Deployed a structured enterprise AI governance and rollout framework to transition AI usage from decentralized experimentation to production-grade workflow integration, embedding measurable oversight without slowing iteration velocity.

## What Was Deployed

Designed a staged deployment model that moved AI integration from controlled pilot environments into systems of record with defined ownership, usage boundaries, and measurable performance signals. Embedded AI into high-friction workflows to reduce manual summarization, intake triage, and routing ambiguity while standardizing documentation and review patterns across teams.

## Systems & Tooling

Integrated AI capabilities into Salesforce as the system of record and leveraged Hightouch for structured attribute synchronization and visibility. Connected deployment to LMS infrastructure for controlled enablement rollout and maintained governance artifacts in version-controlled environments for transparency and repeatability.

## Structural Transformation

Shifted AI from decentralized, individual-led experimentation to governed, sequenced, and system-integrated deployment aligned to enterprise delivery standards and risk management principles.

## Outcomes

Increased cross-functional AI adoption without fragmentation, reduced workflow ambiguity and manual coordination overhead, and established a repeatable enterprise-grade AI deployment framework balancing velocity and governance.
